# Overview

This repository provides an opportunity to work with Git **L**arge **F**ile **S**torage or Git LFS. Git LFS is used to manage larger binary files in the history of your project, something standard Git isn't exceptional at. 

## How to use this repo

ACME Incorporated is planning on using Toggl for time tracking and are using this repository to provide information on how to use Toggl and download the desktop application that has passed the IT Security team's audit. 

Unfortunately, the `.dmg` file was added to the Git repository without using Git LFS and we need to fix that mistake. Perform the steps found in the upcoming sections to successfully retain the `.dmg` file in the project but utilizing Git LFS to maintain it in the project.
